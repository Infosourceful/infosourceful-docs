# Infosourceful Documentation

Welcome to the documentation hub for the Infosourceful Studios and tooling.

This site covers:

- **How to install and run Infosourceful Desktop**
- **How to work with bundles, facets, and provenance**
- **How to use the Evidence, Structure, and Insight Studios**
- **How to integrate with the Infosourceful API**
- **How to develop against the kernel and internal APIs**

What this site is **not**:

- A full description of the Information Archaeology discipline  
  (that will live at `InformationArchaeology.org`).

If you're new, start here:

1. [Install Desktop](getting-started/install-desktop.md)  
2. [Quickstart: Build Your First Binder](getting-started/quickstart-binder.md)

As the product evolves, these docs will track the current Studios, packs, and APIs.
